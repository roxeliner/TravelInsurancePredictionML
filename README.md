# Travel Insurance Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project delves into the Travel Insurance Prediction dataset to forecast the likelihood of customers purchasing travel insurance. Utilizing machine learning techniques and thorough data analysis, this study examines key customer demographics and evaluates various predictive models.

## Objectives
- To conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) for uncovering insights from the Travel Insurance dataset.
- To apply statistical inference for understanding customer demographics' impact on insurance purchases.
- To predict travel insurance purchases using linear machine learning models.
- To refine model performance through hyperparameter tuning and model selection.

## Dataset
The dataset includes customer data such as age, annual income, and family size, among others, aiming to predict the likelihood of purchasing travel insurance. Dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/tejashvi14/travel-insurance-prediction-data).

## Analysis Highlights
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Unveiled the average customer profile and explored correlations between variables.
- **Statistical Inference:** Conducted hypothesis testing to analyze customer demographics' influence on insurance purchases.
- **Model Implementation:** Evaluated models including logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest, with the latter showing the highest accuracy.

## Key Findings
- The decision tree and random forest models were most effective, with accuracies exceeding 92%.
- Hyperparameter tuning further enhanced the random forest model, making it the superior choice for this prediction task.

## Future Work
Further analysis could benefit from:
- Advanced feature engineering to uncover more complex relationships.
- Addressing potential class imbalances to improve model fairness.
- Exploring more sophisticated models and ensemble methods for better predictions.
